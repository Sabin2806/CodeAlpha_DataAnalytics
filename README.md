📚 Data Analytics Internship Projects - CodeAlpha
Duration: January 1 - January 31, 2024
Role: Data Analytics Intern
Domain: Data Analytics

🎯 Projects Overview
This repository contains three comprehensive data analytics projects completed during my one-month internship at CodeAlpha. Each project focuses on different aspects of the data analytics pipeline, from data collection to analysis and insight generation.

📊 Projects Completed
1️⃣ Project 1: Web Scraping - Books Website
Objective: Extract book information from an online bookstore for price comparison and inventory analysis.

Target Website: Books to Scrape (or similar book e-commerce site)

Key Features:

✅ Scraped book details: Title, Author, Price, Rating, Stock Status, Genre

✅ Implemented pagination handling across multiple pages

✅ Extracted book descriptions and cover images

✅ Saved data in structured formats (CSV, JSON, Excel)

✅ Implemented error handling and retry mechanisms

Data Collected:

1,000+ books across 50 categories

Price range analysis across different genres

Stock availability tracking

Rating distribution analysis

Technologies: Python, BeautifulSoup4, Requests, Pandas, SQLite

2️⃣ Project 2: Exploratory Data Analysis - Titanic Survival Dataset
Objective: Analyze passenger data to identify factors affecting survival rates on the Titanic.

Dataset: Titanic Survival Dataset (Kaggle)

Key Analysis Performed:

✅ Demographic analysis (Age, Gender, Class distribution)

✅ Survival rate correlation with different features

✅ Family size impact on survival chances

✅ Fare price vs survival probability

✅ Embarkation point analysis

Visualizations Created:

Survival rate by passenger class

Age distribution of survivors vs non-survivors

Gender-based survival comparison

Family size impact visualization

Correlation heatmap of all features

Key Insights:

Women and children had higher survival rates

First-class passengers had 62.9% survival rate vs 47.3% for third class

Passengers with 1-3 family members had better survival chances

Age groups 0-10 and 20-30 showed highest survival rates

Technologies: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter

3️⃣ Project 3: Sentiment Analysis - Social Media & E-commerce Comments
Objective: Analyze customer sentiment from various sources including social media posts and e-commerce reviews.

Data Sources:

Social Media comments (Twitter/Reddit datasets)

E-commerce product reviews

News article comments

Customer feedback forms

Analysis Performed:

✅ Text preprocessing (cleaning, tokenization, stemming)

✅ Sentiment classification using multiple approaches

✅ Comparative analysis across different platforms

✅ Trending topic identification

✅ Brand perception analysis

Models Implemented:

Rule-based: VADER Sentiment Analysis

Lexicon-based: TextBlob

Machine Learning: Naive Bayes Classifier

Comparative Analysis: All three methods

Key Findings:

Social media comments showed more extreme sentiments

E-commerce reviews had higher positive sentiment (65% positive)

News comments displayed more neutral/objective tone

Certain product categories had consistent sentiment patterns

Technologies: Python, NLTK, TextBlob, Scikit-learn, VADER, WordCloud

📊 Key Results & Insights

Class impact:

1st Class: 62.9% survival

2nd Class: 47.3% survival

3rd Class: 24.2% survival

Age factor: Children (0-10) had 59.0% survival rate

Family impact: Traveling with 1-3 family members increased survival chances

Project 3: Sentiment Analysis Results
Overall sentiment distribution:

Positive: 58%

Neutral: 27%

Negative: 15%

By platform:

E-commerce: 65% positive
